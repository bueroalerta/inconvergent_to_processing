# inconvergent_to_processing

From November 20th to 23rd 2018, Anders Hoff a.k.a. inconvergent, was teaching at the "Master en Innovaci√≥ Audiovisual i Entorns Interactius", at the school BAU, in Barcelona. (https://www.baued.es/ca/estudis/masters-i-postgraus/master-en-innovacio-audiovisual-i-entorns-interactius)

The codes used by Anders are written in p5.js and are available at https://github.com/inconvergent/inconvergent-sandbox.

The sketches in this repo are the translation into Processing of the codes used in this week of classes that Anders taught. They were written just as an exercise, to get from Processing to p5.js, to understand the original codes and to help the students.
